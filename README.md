# SCP:SL Plugin Collection

Collection of plugins that I either deveoped or forked.

### AntiStall:
Wait X seconds and send user a message to move if he is in the same room for long.\
It re-sends a different message after each X seconds.

### DavaStats
Stat storing system, named after Kadava since for his server.\
Planning to add more stats, maybe XP system into it?

### SimpleCustomRoles
Making custom roles simple. With power of Yaml!\
Currently upgrading and making sure this is expandable, and easy to understand.

### XPSystem
This is just a fork. Some things changed but completly abandoned. Will be deleted.
